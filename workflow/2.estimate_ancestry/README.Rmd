## Tasks
1. Preapre iChip 1 to 6 Dataset to match 1000 Genome Reference
    + Will Rayner strand files were used to flip approriate alleles and assign ref/alt status
    + EUR, EAS, AFR phase 1000 Genomes Phase 3 Files were downloaded as reference
    + Ancestry calc ponly performed on high quality SNPs filtered for --geno 0.03, --maf 0.01, --hwe 0.000001, --chr 1-22 
2. 1000 Genome Data was processed to match iChip Data
    + Genome data was filtere to SNPs in common with iChip
    + 1000 Genome data were merged with ichip data
    + Merged dataset was pruned --indep 50 5 1.8, --geno .03, --maf .01
3. Supervised admixture was performed on the merged and pruned dataset
    + samples with >75 EUR ancestry were flagged and each cohort was subsequently split by ancestry
